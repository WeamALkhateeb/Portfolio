             <P>Hi, Iâ€™m weam, and I am a fourth-year Informatic Engineering student with nearly two 
                year of experience in developing mobile applications with Flutter framework . During 
                this 2year, I have worked on approximately three applications at this stage. The work 
                involved designing attractive user interfaces, so I always strive to improve my visual 
                design skills. I have worked well with RESTful APIs and various packages provided by 
                Flutter. I have also worked on building custom widgets and optimizing their usage. 
                Additionally,I now also work on web applications using HTML, CSS, and JS .., I have a strong understanding of algorithms and object-oriented 
                programming concepts, and I am always looking to develop my skills and benefit from 
                the experience of others
            </P>
